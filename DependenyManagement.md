# Dependency Management

## Challenges

- Conflicting versions due to transitive dependencies
- Repeatability of builds
  - Usually realized by lock-files

## Strategies

### Monorepo

Categories:
- Project based
- Containing all code of a company

- Ups:
  - With individual repositories per package, the publication of
    a package is required before it can be used. In a monorepo
    this step can be omitted
  - Ease of using dependent packages within the same repository
    encourages to improve the reusability of code
  - Simplifies large refactorings
- Downs:
  - Requires specialized tools and workflows, for example:
    - [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)
    - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
  - Higher risk of violating the *separation of concerns*
    in a reasonable large code-base due to missing isolation
  - Size, Scalability

### Packages

#### Package Size

##### Micro-Packages

- Ups
  - Less excess of code for unsused functionality per package
- Downs
  - Requires tools to remain maintainable
  - License Management becomes harder
  - Reduces performance

#### Package Management

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Submodules (Git)

### Web Services

#### Microservices

> In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach
> to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
> each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms,
> often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities
> and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.
> There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services,
> which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.
