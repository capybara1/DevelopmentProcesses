# Dependency Management

## Strategies

### Monorepo

Categories:
- Project based
- Containing all code of a company

- Ups:
  - With individual repositories per package, the publication of
    a package is required before it can be used. In a monorepo
    this step can be omitted
  - Ease of using dependent packages within the same repository
    encourages to improve the reusability of code
  - Simplifies large refactorings
- Downs:
  - Requires specialized tools and workflows, for example:
    - [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)
    - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
  - Higher risk of indroducing unintended coupling
    due to missing isolation
  - Size

### Packages

#### Package Size

##### Micro-Packages

- Ups
  - Less excess of code for unsused functionality per package
- Downs
  - Requires tools to remain maintainable
  - License Management becomes harder
  - Reduces performance

#### Package Management

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
